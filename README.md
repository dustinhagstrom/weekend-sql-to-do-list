## Introduction

Ever had something to do? And then you thought of some other things to do? Well, if you answered yes to any of these questions, then I have a web app for you! It is called SQL TO-DO List, and you can use it today to keep track of that growing list of todos. Simply go to the port that is hosting the web app, enter a todo item, and click 'add.' Voila! There goes another tracked todo. Additionally, if you've completed one of your todos, then hit the 'Mark Complete' button. See how many you can do in a day! Then mark them off your list permanently by hitting the 'Delete' button.
